## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Be comfortable working on their own with what they learned from the following readme's:
	* [Math reading](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-math-readme)
	* [Booleans & Operators](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-booleans-readme)

## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int & Double type.
* Utilize the available math operators
* Knows of the Bool type and the various comparison & logical operators.

## Outline / Notes

*  15-20 questions reasonable? Is that too much??
* Start with some easy wins for the student to solidify the basics and have them becoming more familiar with the syntax as they type it out.
* Get more challenging if possible near the end. 
* Maybe have the last question challenge them on something we haven't taught them yet which would require them googling it?
